A small Unity game engine project made for a job application. It's a mobile spin-the-wheel trivia game. User selects any number of categories before starting a session and a wheel mesh is created dynamically based on the number of categories, each category being a slice on the wheel.

I've also designed a simple user interface for this. The whole project including the graphics took about 4-5 hours.
